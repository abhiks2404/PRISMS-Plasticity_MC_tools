# PRISMS-PF_MC_tools
**Tools for integration between PRISMS-PF and Materials Commons**

The script files in this repository can be used to assist with automation of the following tasks:
- Locally importing PRISMS-PF code files and simulation results into a Materials Commons project directory
- For each calculation (simulation) directory, sorting the different file types into different subdirectories
- Creating a yaml file containing data and metadata for each simulation and adding these data to an ETL spreadsheet associated with an Experiment in Materials Commons
- Generating image frames and movies for different field variables within a phase-field simulation
